        <section class="text-container">
            <p>I’m a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Baguio with a love for games, art, and storytelling. I’ve been part of the UB community since the 7th grade, and while the journey has taken a few unexpected turns—from Science High to STEM, HUMCOM, and finally ICT—it’s been all part of finding what fits.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Raised in Bicol and now living near the BenCab Museum in Asin (though ironically, still haven’t been inside), I bring a mix of experiences that shape how I see the world—and how I create in it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I’m not exploring real-time, turn-based, and deckbuilders like <em>Fire Emblem, FF Tactics, Minedustry, Pokémon Rescue Team and TCG</em>, you’ll probably find me sketching on paper or folding them. I enjoy getting lost in stories—whether it’s through games, day-dreaming, or watching <b>ABSOLUTE CINEMA's</b> like <em>Arcane</em>, <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>, or <em>Christopher Nolan's Films</em>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Life is all about finding balance, leveling up in life, and staying curious. Just like hydration, creativity and play are things I believe should flow daily.</p>

            <h1>About this Logo</h1>
            <img src="resources/logo_old.jpg" alt="A Logo containing 4 cards standin towards eachother forminh the letter M with 1 raven and 1 number 6 printed on the face. There's a coin beside it carved to look like the letter G. Alltogehter the Spells out MG" class="logo_old">
        </section>
        <section class="text-container">
            <p>This logo is a personal tribute to two things I really like: <em>Star Wars</em> and corvids. I really liked Sith Lord Revan when <em>Star Wars Legends</em> was still canon.</p>
            <br>
            <p>“Raven” is jus an uncreative play on words that to me represents the character and the bird. The number 66 comes from the iconic Order 66, the tragic massacre of the Jedi Order.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I placed them on cards as a reference to the many turn-based card games I’ve played and loved, The Logo has an overall simple meaning, with no cohesive connection to everything Iv'e mentioned so far.</p>
